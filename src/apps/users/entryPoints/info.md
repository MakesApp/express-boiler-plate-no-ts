This is where the requests or events enter your application. In a web application, these are typically the routes or endpoints that your application exposes. They handle incoming requests, perform some initial processing or validation (like checking if required parameters are present), and then pass the request to the appropriate function in the domain layer to handle the business logic. In other words, they serve as the "gate" to your application.
