This layer is responsible for interacting with your data sources (like databases, external APIs, file systems, etc.). It's where you'll find code for querying your database, making HTTP requests to external services, reading/writing files, and so on. The data-access layer provides an abstraction over these operations, so your domain layer doesn't need to know the specifics of how data is stored or retrieved. This makes it easier to change your data storage technology if needed, without affecting the rest of your application.
